## __LEMP PROJECT__ 

LEMP is an open-source web application stack used to develop web applications. The term LEMP is an acronym that represents L for the Linux Operating system, Nginx (pronounced as engine-x, hence the E in the acronym) web server, M for MySQL database, and P for PHP scripting language


## INSTALL THE NGINX WEB SERVER

N stands for Nginx: An open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. When a web browser requests a web page that request is handled by the web server, here that web server is Nginx. Then the webserver passes that request to server-side technologies used in the LEMP stack for instance as a server-side scripting language like PHP to communicate with server and database.

- Update the ubuntu repositries 

```
sudo apt update
```     
                                       
- Install  Nginx

```
sudo apt install nginx
```

Verify that nginx has  successfully installed:

```
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

- Open TCP port 80 which is default port that web browsers use to access web pages in the Internet.
                                                
                                                                                      
- Use ‘curl’ command to request Nginx on port 80:

```
 curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4                                                                                                                       ```
```

## INSTALL MYSQL

M stands for MySQL: MySQL is a popular relational database management system used within PHP environments.

- Install  MySql: 

```                                
sudo apt install mysql-server                                   
```     

 ![P2A (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93116204/139405644-5b17265f-078c-40e0-956a-80f0b917936d.png)

- Run the security script - this comes pre-installed with mysql. This script removes some insecure default settings and locks down access to your database system. if you do not VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN the server will still ask for you to  select and confirm a password for the MySQL root user.

```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

- Log into my sql

```
sudo mysql    
```

```
mysql> exit
```                                                                                                   
                                  
![P2B(3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93116204/139410870-35d4a402-f33a-4bf5-8289-c60b101fdde8.png)

- MySQL server is now installed and secured.


### INSTALL PHP

P stands for PHP: It stands for Hypertext Preprocessor and is a scripting language that works on the server-side and communicates with the database MySQL and does all operations which user requests, like fetching data, adding data, or manipulating data, or processing the data. PHP processes code and generates dynamic content for the web server. Nginx requires an external program to handle PHP processing and act as a bridge between the PHP interpreter itself and the web server. 

* php-fpm, which stands for “PHP fastCGI process manager”, tells Nginx to pass PHP requests to this software for processing
* php-mysql, allows PHP to communicate with MySQL-based databases

Install php-fpm and php-mysql by running command:

``` 
sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql
```

 ## Configure Nginx to Use PHP Processor

On Ubuntu 20.04, Nginx has one server block enabled by default and is configured to serve documents out of a directory at /var/www/html. While this works well for a single site, it can become difficult to manage if you are hosting multiple sites. Instead of modifying /var/www/html, we’ll create a directory structure within /var/www for the your_domain website, leaving /var/www/html in place as the default directory to be served if a client request does not match any other sites.

 
* Create the root web directory for your domain:

```
sudo mkdir /var/www/projectLEMP
```

* Assign ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable:

```
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectLEMP
```


* Open a new configuration file in Nginx’s sites-available directory:

```
 sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP
 ```
                                                                       
![P2C (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93116204/139503892-11fb19f7-e99c-4e0b-8035-fb309211b588.png)


- Paste in the following bare-bones configuration 

```

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
    root /var/www/projectLEMP;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}
                                                                       
```

- Activate the configuration by linking to config file to the Nginx’s sites-enabled directory. This will tell Nginx to use the configuration next time it is reloaded.

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

- Test the configuration for syntax errors:

```
 sudo nginx -t
 ```

- Disable the Default Nginx host  

```
sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

- In order to apply the changes I reloaded Nginx using command:

```
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```
                                                
                                                
- In order to test that the new server block functions create a  index.html file in /var/www/projectLEMP location:

```
sudo echo 'Hello LEMP from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) 'with public IP' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/projectLEMP/index.html
```

## TEST PHP WITH NGINX

- At this point, the LAMP stack is completely installed and fully operational. To validate that it can correctly hand Nginx php files off to your PHP processor create a test PHP file in the document root by opening a new file called info.ophp

```
sudo vi /var/www/projectLEMP/info.php
```

- Enter a valid PHP code that will return information about the server:

```
<?php
phpinfo();
```

- Access this page in the web browser by visiting the public IP address, followed by info.php


![Screen-27-11-2021_080928](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93116204/143673967-442a47b2-1ffe-482f-ab06-69b8f2e6974e.png)


                                                                                                               
- Remove the file created as it contains sensitive information about the PHP environment and the Ubuntu server with command below: 

```
sudo rm /var/www/your_domain/info.php
```
                                                                                                                  
## Retrieving data from MySQL database with PHP

- Connect to MySql using the root account:  

```
sudo mysql
```                                              
                                                                                     
- Create a new database called example_database

```
CREATE DATABASE `example_database`;
```                                                                                                                                                                      
CREATE USER 'example_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';

- Give user permission over the example_database database:

```
GRANT ALL ON example_database.* TO 'example_user'@'%';
```                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                           
- To to test if the new user has the proper permissions to log into the MySQL console again, this time use the custom user credentials:

```
mysql -u example_user -p
```                                                                                                                                           

*Screenshot below*

![2a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93116204/144015251-869ea381-4e5c-452d-b520-f5839f59584d.png)

                                                                                 
- Confirm that you have access to the example_database database:

```
SHOW DATABASES;
```                                                                                 

*Screenshot below*

![2b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93116204/144015734-502c3018-f126-43a1-b7f1-9f46ef2d24ac.png)


- Create a test table named todo_list From the MySQL console with statement:

```
CREATE TABLE example_database.todo_list (item_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, content VARCHAR(255),PRIMARY KEY(item_id));
```

- Insert a few rows of content in the test table. You might want to repeat the next command a few times, using different VALUES:

```
mysql> INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list (content) VALUES ("My first important item");
``` 

- To confirm that the data was successfully saved to the table, run this command:

```
SELECT * FROM example_database.todo_list;
```                                                                                  

![2e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93116204/144017269-dcd93a4b-cf1f-4461-9fcc-2ce20fcc7ceb.png)

- exit mysql 

```
mysql> exit
```
- Now you can create a PHP script that will connect to MySQL and query for your content. Create a new PHP file in your custom web root directory using your preferred editor                                                                                                                                                                      

```
vi /var/www/projectLEMP/todo_list.php
```

- Enter the script below into todo_list.php:

```
<?php
$user = "example_user";
$password = "password";
$database = "example_database";
$table = "todo_list";

try {
  $db = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=$database", $user, $password);
  echo "<h2>TODO</h2><ol>";
  foreach($db->query("SELECT content FROM $table") as $row) {
    echo "<li>" . $row['content'] . "</li>";
  }
  echo "</ol>";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    print "Error!: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
    die();
}
```      

- You can now access this page in your web browser by visiting the domain name or public IP address configured for your website, followed by /todo_list.php:
